IX
  If research with practical impact gets rewarded, and research without practical impact does not, then researchers are going to prefer to work on research that may have practical impact.

  Part of identifying which research may have practical impact is to consider the size of the effect that it may have, in addition to it's potential to achieve statistical significance.

    [Re-reference earlier refs?]

  So, while the potential for statistical significance would still be sought after in studies, it would not be the only, or the most important thing.  Research likely to reveal a correlation that is statistically significant correlation, yet has a trivial effect size, would be set aside.
