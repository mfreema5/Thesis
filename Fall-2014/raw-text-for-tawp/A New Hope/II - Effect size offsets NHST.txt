  How can we prevent researchers from spending time and resources on empirical studies that produce statistically valid but ultimately unimportant results?

  One way is to include a consideration of the size of effect along with the statistical significance in judging the potential value of a study.

<a href="references.html#schwab2011" >Schwab <i>et al.</i> (2011)</a> recommend that in the behavioral and social sciences "researchers should show the substantive importance of findings by reporting effect sizes".

When <a href="references.html#fidler2004" >Fidler <i>et al.</i> (2004)</a> reviewed various statistical reforms in medicine, psychology and other fields, using effects size to supplant the importance afforded to NHST came up repeatedly.  For example, they report that the guidelines from an APA Task Force on Statistical Inference for  publishing statistical results “strongly emphasised the need for measures of effect size to be the primary outcome of a study, and the need to differentiate clinical or practical significance from statistical significance.”
