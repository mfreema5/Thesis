A practical impact metric would give researchers a tool to differentiate between research based on the potential for importance, instead of differentiating based only on the potential for statistical significance.

With a practical impact metric, researchers would have both the means and the motivation to maximize the potential for importance of their research, in addition to its maximizing its potential for publication.
