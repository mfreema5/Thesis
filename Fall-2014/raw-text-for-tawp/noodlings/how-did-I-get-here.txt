Researchers abuse NHST by researching any correlation that's statistically “significant”, ignoring all other attributes of the correlation.

How can we prevent/correct this abuse of NHST?

Include the effect size along with the statistical significance in judging the importance of a correlation.


How to prevent/correct NHST abuse? ⇒ consider effect size

How to measure/estimate effect size? ⇒ consider “would a practitioner care”?

How to know “would a practitioner care”? ⇒ ask a practitioner

Ask a practitioner what, exactly? ⇒ ask what research they find useful

But witnesses are unreliable; better way to know what research they find useful?
  ⇒ find what research a practitioners are using and/or discussing among themselves

When a practitioner uses or mentions research ⇒ call that “practical impact”

Compile “practical impact” ⇒ practical impact metric

How to use practical impact metric? ⇒ reward research that scores practical impact

Rewarding research with “practical impact”
  ⇒ researchers focus on research more likely to have “practical impact”

How do you identify research likely to have “practical impact”?
  ⇒ consider effect size, among other things

If the effect size of correlations are important to researchers
  ⇒ researchers ignore correlations that have small effects, irrespective of their statistical “significance”
