###What’s the article about?

It seems to be yet another explanation of why statistical significance testing is not, in and of itself, enough to claim you've found something.

From the abstract:

>Instead of making NHSTs, researchers should adapt their research assessments to specific contexts and specific research goals, and then explain their rationales for selecting assessment indicators.

I'm hoping for a bit more about “contexts” and “specific research goals”, as maybe a lead-in to practical application.

##First time you read

###What are the ~~main~~ interesting claims?

>“NHSTs Corrode Researchers' Motivation and Ethics”

When statistical significance is the main or only criteria for publication: “Success in research can become a mere game played to achieve promotion or visibility, not a high calling in pursuit of useful knowledge and societal benefit.”

>“Medical research is more expensive, receives much more funding, makes more of a difference to more people, and draws much more attention. Thus, medical researchers have greater incentive to measure and document effects of their work and to avoid promulgating treatments that turn out later to have been ineffective or harmful.”

* practical impact = “makes more of a difference to more people”
* practical impact = “avoid promulgating treatments that [are] ineffective or harmful”

###What are the ~~conclusions~~ recommendations?

Researchers need to assess and discuss “actions that their findings might stimulate….”

>“Aguinis et al. (2010) have recommended that researchers ought to distinguish between effect size and practical significance and assess them separately.”

>“Researchers' challenge is to enhance readers' understanding by balancing simplicity against depth. Simplicity enhances clarity, whereas complex- ity fosters future research and further development of indicators.”


>“When null hypotheses could not possibly be true, you can remark that those NHSTs show only that the impossible did not happen.”

>“When research examines a population or a nonrandom sample, you can indicate that NHSTs are inappropriate.”

>“When findings are not statistically significant but they might hold substantive importance, you can highlight their potential importance.”
