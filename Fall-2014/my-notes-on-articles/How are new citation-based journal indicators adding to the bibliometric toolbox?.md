###What are the main claims?

  * ¿ “one should not confuse impact with influence” ?
    * Bensman, S. J. (2007). “Garfield and the Impact Factor.” *Annual Review of Information Science and Technology*, 41, 93-155.

  * “The Impact Factor does not measure the impact or influence of a journal, but of an average item published in that journal”
    * Harter, S. P., & Nisonger, T. E. (1997). “ISI’s impact factor as misnomer: a proposed new measure to assess journal impact”. *Journal of the American Society for Information Science*, 48(12), 1146-1148.

  * “Bensman (1996; Bensman & Wilder, 1998) concluded that the total number of citations correlates much better with the perceived importance of a journal than with its impact as defined by the JCR”
    * Bensman, S. J. (1996). “The structure of the library market for scientific journals: The case of chemistry”. *Library Resources & Technical Services*, 40, 145-170.
    * Bensman, S. J., & Wilder, S. J. (1998). “Scientific and Technical Serials Holdings Optimization in an Inefficient Market: A LSU Serials Redesign Project Exercise”. *Library Resources and Technical Services*, 42(3), 147-242.

* **“Are the various indicators complementary or essentially measuring the same underlying dimension?”**


###What are the conclusions?

* Results
  * Journal indicators
  * Network indicators
  * Stability and change

>The data contains two dimensions, size and impact, which—quoting Garfield—together shape influence. Any inference which jumps too easily from one dimension to another may lead to misunderstandings. As Garfield emphasized, one should not consider the Impact Factor as an indicator of the quality of a journal, but as an indicator of the average quality of articles in that journal. A comparison with the size dimension makes this point clear: the average size of an article does not inform us about the size of the journal. However, this warning against an “ecological fallacy”—that is failing to note the difference between making inferences about the aggregate of trees or of the woods—has hitherto been little heeded in studies using the Impact Factor for research evaluation (Robertson, 1950; Kreft & De Leeuw, 1988; Moed, 2005). Journals, however, are not homogenous entities (Bradford, 1934; Garfield, 1971; Bensman, 2007).
