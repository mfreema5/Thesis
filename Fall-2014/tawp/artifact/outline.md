#Outline for artifact

## Practical impact

* What?
  * When research informs practice
* Why?
  * On-going empirical research into trivial correlations in social sciences
  * Lack of relevance in management research
  * Value of practical impact may not be captured by citation metrics
  * Increasing demand to demonstrate practical value of research by funding agencies

## Tracking practical impact

* Altmetrics breaks out of academic silo that isolates most bibliometric methods
* Passive-impact methods (e.g., Mendeley readership analysis) break out of relying on the almost exclusively academic behavior of citation
* CWTS research branch looking for “societal value of research”
* HEFCE-REF – requires submission of “cases” demonstrating impact
  * Review board for submitted cases comprises both researchers and practitioners

## Uses of practical impact information

* Determination of funding (e.g., HEFCE-REF)
* Judging “quality of research”
* Improving knowledge transfer between researchers and practitioners

## Hazards of making practical value requisite

* Lose important research with no practical value
  * Research into fundamental laws and principles
  * Research into methodologies which enable research that will have practical value

## Hazards of ignoring practical value

* “Gaming” system through statistical power [see: Problems]
* Losing funding [see: HEFCE-REF]
* Rewards that are based only citation-metrics begets research that maximizes citations, and only citations
* Is it ethical to leave practitioners ignorant of knowledge that would improve their outcomes?

## Rewarding practical impact

* Avoid both
  * …the hazard of requiring practical impact, and
  * …the hazard of ignoring practical impact

## Categorizing practical impact

* Comparisons should always be within the same, or similar, fields
* Qualitative process
  * Too many possible sources for practical impact data to equitably quantify
  * Different fields have widely varying levels of practical impact
* Levels:
  * U – Unknown/undefined
    * No examples of practical impact
  * A – Apparent
    * At least one example of practical impact
  * I – Important
    * Multiple examples of practical impact; has more impact than other research in the same field (with at least an A-level)

## Future research

* Comparing practical impact with citation-impact
  * Differences (over time) in citation-impact between research with different practical impacts
* Comparing practical impact of empirical research with the statistical power of that research
  * Hypothesis: a negative correlation
* Comparing practical impact of empirical and theoretical research
