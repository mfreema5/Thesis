tawp - Thesis As Web Pages
====

This will be both:
* Submitted as the final deliverable for my Thesis hours, Fall 2014
* Submitted as Project 4 for COM 530 - “Standards-based Web Design”
  * For more details on how these web pages integrate into COM 530, see: [Alternative project 4](https://github.com/mfreema5/COM530-notes/blob/master/alternate-proj4-intent.md).

A recent version of ‘tawp’ can be seen live at: [www.freeman.blue](http://www.freeman.blue).

##Changed to using [haml] and [less]

I've created `.haml` files for the `.html` files, and `.less` files for the `.css`.  So, if you make pull requests with changes directly to the `.html` or `.css` files, I won't be able to auto-merge them.  Not that I'll ignore them.  I'll take recommedations for improvements in any form you want to give them.  But changes to the files in `~/src` would be favourite.
