# Research question:

How can you identify when practitioners take notice of research?  Can you quantify this “practical impact”?

## Sub-questions:

*  How do you build (assign people to) classes of “researchers” and “practitioners”?
*  What hooks (other information) do you want to include in a quantification of practical impact?


----

## Deliverables

* Narrow scope
* First complete draft of literature review of existing methods/resources for this and similar processes

Future deliverables:
* Specific resources that can be used to generate practical impact data
* “Proof of concept” code and preliminary results
