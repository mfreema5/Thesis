# Research question:

How can you identify when practitioners take notice of research?  Can you quantify this “practical impact”?

## Sub-questions:

*  How do you build (assign people to) classes of “researchers” and “practitioners”?
*  What hooks (other information) do you want to include in a quantification of practical impact?
