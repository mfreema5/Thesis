It sounds simple enough.  But when the processes being studied are complex, and the interaction between the elements within the process are subtle, the knowledge that researchers prize from their studies can often be difficult to translate into a tool that practitioners to use.





Finding and publishing knowledge that *could* become a tool for practitioners is not an example of practical impact.  Practitioners must at least become aware of the knowledge before we...




[Schwab recommends something similar in…].  But doing that is not only difficult, it also leaves a lot of ambiguity because it involves merely speculating on practical applications.  [Which can lead to other problems: complaints, arguments, nepotism, etcetcetc.]

However, tracking “practical impact” through direct evidence of practitioners using, referencing or reading published research is less ambiguous.  And it doesn't require that researchers develop a practical application of their research, or necessarily even understand how their research is being used in a practical application.
