How to track ‘impact’ of academic publications:

* site “liked” data
* amazon sales data
* altmetric for practical impact

** Impacts that are measurable?  Ones that are unmeasurable?

# Examples
## LSE Impact of Social Sciences blog (http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/)

* London school of economics
* "Impact roundup"
**  "How to make relevant and useful"?

¿whotweet?
¿hootsuite (https://hootsuite.com)?


* Libby knows about:
**  tweet mining
***   features of tweets that go viral

**  “Celebrities” class of twitter users
***   Imdb top 5000 to ID celebrities


# Questions for me:
* Watch users or watch tweets?

* User
**  "who goes in your set"
**  URLs (not hashtags)

* Tweets
**  "what goes in your set"
**  URLs of journals
***   (do they leave the bubble)


# twitter search API
**  (libby knows about this stuff - has server and can add jobs)
*** Server queries Twitter and uses Python to store data in MySQL database.
* twitter search API docs
**  "advanced search page"
***   (Only returns indexed tweets)
***   (Only 0-14 days in time)
