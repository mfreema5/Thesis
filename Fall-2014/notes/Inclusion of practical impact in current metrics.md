#Inclusion of ‘practical impact’ in current metrics

Are the potential indicators of practical impact already being included in existing “impact” metrics?

That question becomes easier to approach if you first consider the following definitions of the metrics-related fields. (They are based on the historical survey given by [Hood & Wilson (2001)](http://doi.org/10.1023/A:1017919924342) – see also the local file [“Bibliometrics vs. Scientometrics vs. Informetrics”](/Fall-2014/notes/Bibliometrics%20vs.%20Scientometrics%20vs.%20Informetrics.md).)

* *Bibliometrics*
  * The quantitative study of scholarly articles and/or books, or electronic equivalents (i.e., the typical material in an academic “bibliography”).
* *Scientometrics*
  * The quantitative study of science as an activity. The journal [*Scientometrics*](http://link.springer.com/journal/11192) describes the field as covering “the quantitative features and characteristics of science and scientific research”, and specifically “the development and mechanism of science.” Scientometrics can have application in making science policy.
    * Scientometrics overlaps with those bibliometrics that are applied to the field of science.
* Informetrics
  * Most any definition of informetrics would subsume both bibliometrics and scientometrics, since it is the quantitative study of science communication.  But, since the other two fields are established, “informetrics” is typically only used to refer to analyses which fall outside of bibliometrics and scientometrics.
  * More interestingly, [Ingwersen & Christensen (1997)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/%28SICI%291097-4571%28199703%2948:3%3C205::AID-ASI3%3E3.0.CO;2-0/abstract) defined informetrics as:
  “The term informetrics designates a recent extension of the traditional bibliometric analyses also to cover non-scholarly communities in which information is produced, communicated, and used.”
