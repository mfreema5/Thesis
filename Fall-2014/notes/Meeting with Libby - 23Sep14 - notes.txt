* Any factor that "counts" is easy to game.
  * What other drawbacks to metrics?
  * Can you fix by counting something else?

* Positive result bias - an additional problem with counting-type metric
  * Not counting what's not out there
    * Similar to Type-II

(*Unexpressed thought: bias against replication articles, since they don't boost JIF.*)

* Look for review/summary articles in Bibliometrics

* Question of audience for metrics
  * Who is the impact factor for?
    * Tenure and promotion committees, among others
  * Who would be the audience for a practical impact factor?
  * Librarians no longer use JIF
    * Instead use faculty surveys for what journals to carry
      *Is that published/accessible?

##Ways to present the info

* Table: common challenges to impact factors, summary of how each factor deals with it
  * e.g., self citation, gaming, intra-field comparisons, etc.

* Table: data they use
  * Covering the various variants of JIFs, plus various altmetrics
  * What's the same, what's different?

* Can you argue that:
  * ¿ The data's wrong ?
  * ¿ Nothing overcomes (these) problems ?
