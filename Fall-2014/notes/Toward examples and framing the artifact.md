#Online artifact

I've gotten the go ahead from Karl to use this thesis as the subject for the next project in COM 530.  So, the final deliverable for this semester will be an online artifact.

I've been trying to get a some idea of how to tie all the things together.  To create a the global structure for the thesis, because that will determine what pages I need to write/create for the artifact, and how they'll be linked to each other.

A visual note on that:

#Examples of practical impact

It turns out that the UK's Research Excellence Framework (see note: [HEFCE – REF](/Fall-2014/notes/HEFCE-REF.md)) did a trial run back in 2010, and had various institutions submit “pilot cases” for demonstrating impact.  I'm going to try to track down some of those, to see if they give specific examples of research publications.
