#[University-Industry Research Connections 2014](http://www.cwts.nl/UIRC2014)

>UIRC 2014 is a publicly-available information tool on university-industry research connections and cooperation worldwide. …The empirical information is derived from our in-house data-mining and data-analysis of *university-industry co-publications* (UICs).

>Each UIC contains at least one author affiliate address referring to that 'source' university and one or more addresses referring to a business enterprise. As such, these co-authored research publications represent a visible link between a university and industry. …Background information on this analytical approach can be found in:

>>Tijssen, R.J.W. (2012). “Co-authored research publications and strategic analysis of public-private collaboration”, *Research Evaluation*, 21, 204-215. (paper)

>The UICs were extracted from the… 'Thomson Reuters' Web of Science (WoS)….

##UIC performance indicators

>UIC intensity (**% UICs**) is the fraction of UICs within the total WoS-indexed publication output. This is an indicator of UIC activity that corrects for the entire research output of a university.

(The other indicators are concerned with the breakdown of regional vs. international cooperation.)
