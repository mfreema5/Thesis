###Meeting with Libby on 30-Sep-14

* Insight: eigenvalue centrality must be about journals, since the connections between nodes don't really work out for individual articles.
  * *(Doesn't SJR work on individual articles?)*

* Should at some point create two tables.  One each about:
  * The factors themselves
  * The data that goes into it each factor.

* Tables aren't the end product, necessarily.  They're just a map of what you do and don't know.
  * End-product tables should tell the story you want to tell, meaning only include what's of interest to the issue at hand (or required to back that up).

* Possibly limit search by looking at “classes” of metrics.

* For next week, a vacation from metrics:
  * **Why is practical impact a useful thing to consider?**
