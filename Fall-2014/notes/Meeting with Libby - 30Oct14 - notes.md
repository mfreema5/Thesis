##Notes with Libby

Possible path for PI: “Slideshare.net” API

Identify PI through time-lag patterns in citation impact?

* Find examples of PI, look for patterns in citation-impact
  * Don't normally expect dips (local minima)
  * Don't expect a lag

*Stats &ndash; technicalities
  * Correlations: transformation
  * 16-standard transformations
  * Multivariate regression
    * What independent control variables for PI?
  * Time-series analysis
  * Baysian
    * Nate Silver – “The Signal and the Noise”

(Firms don't partner for R&D, they hire consults.  But it may not be entirely the same: are they paying for research, or are they paying for answers?)


##To do

* Look for patterns of in citation impact that are different between papers with and papers without known practical impact.
  * Ask around for examples of research with practical impact
* Basic framing for thesis artifact
  * Get OK from Karl
