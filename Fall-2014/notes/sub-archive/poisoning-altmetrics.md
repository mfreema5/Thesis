##[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/wtf) — “IF This, Then That”

Web service that does “actions” based on “triggers”.  Both of which may involve social media.  These are called “recipes”.

Example recipes:
* [Simply label a Gmail “Evernote” to send it there](https://ifttt.com/recipes/2174-simply-label-a-gmail-evernote-to-send-it-there)
* [If you post a link on Facebook this Recipe will also tweet it automatically](https://ifttt.com/recipes/105786-if-you-post-a-link-on-facebook-this-recipe-will-also-tweet-it-automatically)
* [Add a new Wordpress post & it updates your Facebook Page with a link post](https://ifttt.com/recipes/10336-add-a-new-wordpress-post-it-updates-your-facebook-page-with-a-link-post)

The last two can poison altmetric social-media searches by doubling hits.  You could possibly build a chain of recipes that increase your altmetric social-media hits infinitely.  (I'm guessing they automatically check for loop-bombs.  But maybe not… that's something to explore later.  With someone else's social-media accounts.)
