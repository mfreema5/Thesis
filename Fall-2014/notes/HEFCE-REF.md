#HEFCE – REF

##Higher Education Funding Council for England

###Research Excellence Framework

HEFCE-REF is a UK government initiative concerning funding science that is apparently asking questions about “practical impact” and related issues of “societal value”.  I should probably at least do a fly-by on that, as an additional justification on why we should care.

###REF2014: A brief guide for research users

From the PDF of the same name.

>**The impact of research** &ndash; The REF will for the first time explicitly assess the impact of research beyond academia, as well as assessing the academic excellence of research. One purpose of the REF is to reward research departments in universities that engage with business, the public sector and civil society organisations, and carry new ideas through to beneficial outcomes

>*Universities are responsible for gathering and submitting evidence of the impact of their research*. Each submission must include:

>• Case studies of impacts that took place during 2008-2013. The underpinning research must be of high quality, and carried out by the university since 1993.

>• An impact strategy to set out how the university engages with users and facilitates impact from its research.

>Impact will be assessed jointly by academics and **research users** on the REF expert panels. All of the expert panels include some research users.

>**What do we mean by ‘impact’?**

>The benefits that can flow from excellent research are many and varied. For the purposes of the REF, impact is defined as: *“any effect on, change or benefit to the economy, society, culture, public policy or services, health, the environment or quality of life, beyond academia.”*

###Publication of other REF material

See: [Arrangements for the publication of results](http://www.ref.ac.uk/pubs/arrangementsforthepublicationofresults/).

>In early 2015, we will publish the submissions on the REF website. For each submission we will publish: a separate list of staff and outputs; the submitted case studies and impact template; and the submitted environment data and template. We will remove personal and contractual details of staff, and any other data that the HEI has indicated should not be published for commercial sensitivity or other reasons. HEIs have had the opportunity to provide redacted versions of case studies, impact templates and environment templates for the purpose of publication.

###REF Impact Pilot

Even better:

>The [Imperial College London] participated in the HEFCE pilot to assess how impact might be measured in the REF.

To do: check out [the ICL webpage](http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/planning/strategicprojects/researchassessment/development/impactpilot) for PDFs of example cases.   And maybe track down more of such things.
