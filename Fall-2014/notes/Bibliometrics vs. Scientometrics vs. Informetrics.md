#Bibliometrics vs. Scientometrics vs. Informetrics

Hood, William W., and Concepción S. Wilson. 2001. “The Literature of Bibliometrics, Scientometrics, and Informetrics.” *Scientometrics* 52 (2): 291–314. doi:[10.1023/A:1017919924342](http://doi.org/10.1023/A:1017919924342).


##Bibliometrics

>[Broadus (1987b, p. 376)](http://doi.org/10.1007/BF02016680) reviews various other definitions, and then provides the following:

>>“... the quantitative study of physical published units, or of bibliographic units, or of surrogates of either ...”.


##Scientometrics

>Much of scientometrics is indistinguishable from bibliometrics, and much bibliometric research is published in the journal, *Scientometrics*.

>Another definition is provided by [Tague-Sutcliffe (1992a, p. 1)](http://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4573(92)90087-G):

>>“Scientometrics is the study of the quantitative aspects of science as a discipline or economic activity. It is part of the sociology of science and has application to science policy-making. It involves quantitative studies of scientific activities, including, among others, publication, and so overlaps bibliometrics to some extent”.


##Informetrics

>Informetrics may subsume scientometrics and more especially, bibliometrics; however, workers in the three metric areas will continue to use the term they feel most closely describes their understanding of their work. In particular, researchers outside the information science discipline will continue to use the more familiar (and established) term, bibliometrics.

>A brief definition is implicitly provided by [Egghe & Rousseau (1990b, p. iii)](http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/002225028) in the subtitle of their book:

>>“Informetrics: Quantitative Methods in Library, Documentation and Information Science.”

>Informetrics covers the empirical studies of literature and documents, as well as theoretical studies of the mathematical properties of the laws and distributions that have been discovered.

>[Ingwersen & Christensen (1997, p. 13)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-4571(199703)48:3%3C205::AID-ASI3%3E3.0.CO;2-0/abstract) have the following definition:

>>“The term informetrics designates a recent extension of the traditional bibliometric analyses also to cover non-scholarly communities in which information is produced, communicated, and used.”

----

It's almost like “non-scholarly communities in which information is produced, communicated, and used” might actually be important.

Anyway, I've been using the term “bibliometrics”, but “informetrics” is probably more appropriate.
