#21 Oct 14

##For 28 Oct:

* Look into Leiden
  * “Let me make sure I'm not re-inventing the wheel.”

##Due in five weeks.

* It's important to know how to use a reference manager for automagical insertion of references, and building of bibliography.

##Final deliverable – “Think about what form this artifact will take.”

* Many formats are acceptable.
  * Standard literature review
  * Collection of markdown'd documents
  * Webpage(s)
    * Libby won't mind if it's combined with some project for Karl's class.

“Think about what form this artifact will take.”
