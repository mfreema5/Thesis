Systemic uses in adoption

Problems for practitioners when trying to apply research knowledge
*  Recognizing match between theory and real-life problem

Example of requiring practical impact:

>Exploring the nature of ethnographic inquiry, this paper suggests that “implications for design” may not be the best metric for evaluation and may, indeed, fail to capture the value of ethnographic investigations.
