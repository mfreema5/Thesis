#How can you identify when practitioners take notice of research?

#Can you quantify this “practical impact”?

## Sub-questions:

*  How do you build (assign people to) classes of “researchers” and “practitioners”?
*  What hooks (other information) do you want to include in a quantification of practical impact?

# Deliverables

* Narrow scope
* First complete draft of literature review of existing methods/resources for this and similar processes

Libby recommend narrowing the scope.

* Based on what?
  * Available data
  * Clear distinctions between R and P
  * Clear correlation between research and practical impact
  * Existing research/resources

* But all fields?  Better to stick to something I know, or that I know people who know.
  * Management
  * Chemistry
  * Communication
  * Software?

* Back to “What do we mean by practical impact?”
  * Start with:
    * Altmetrics
    * LSE blog
