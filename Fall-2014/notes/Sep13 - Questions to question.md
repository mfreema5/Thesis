#How can you identify when practitioners take notice of research?

#Can you quantify this “practical impact”?

## Sub-questions:

*  How do you build (assign people to) classes of “researchers” and “practitioners”?
*  What hooks (other information) do you want to include in a quantification of practical impact?

# Deliverables

* Narrow scope
* First complete draft of literature review of existing methods/resources for this and similar processes

Libby recommend narrowing the scope.

* Based on what?
  * Available data
  * Clear distinctions between R and P
  * Clear correlation between research and practical impact
  * Existing research/resources

* But all fields?  Better to stick to something I know, or that I know people who know.
  * Management
  * Chemistry
  * Communication
  * Software?

* Back to “What do we mean by practical impact?”
  * Start with:
    * Altmetrics
    * LSE blog

###[Impactstory](https://impactstory.org)

>Impactstory is an open-source, web-based tool that helps researchers explore and share the diverse impacts of all their research products—from traditional ones like journal articles, to emerging products like blog posts, datasets, and software. By helping researchers tell data-driven stories about their impacts, we're helping to build a new scholarly reward system that values and encourages web-native scholarship. We’re funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and incorporated as a nonprofit corporation. [impactstory.org/faq](https://impactstory.org/faq)
