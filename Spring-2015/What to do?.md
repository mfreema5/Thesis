After thinking about it for awhile, I realized that I don't want to start a PhD program right away, so the thesis on “practical impact” seems too academic in focus.

Instead of theorizing about the practical impact of academic research, I think I would like to engage in it.  By trying to either explain or demonstrate practical ways to apply knowledge from academic research.

###Two ideas:

1. A web-based guide to selecting computer-mediate communication
  * Discuss the research behind the guide
  * Simplistic “wizard” to narrow down possible solutions, based on goal/context?
  * Need:
    * Many specific examples of computer-mediate communications
    * Specific examples of use cases
  * Deliverable:
    * Web pages that comprise guide
      * Include research citations
      * Both specific and generalized solutions
        * Specific solutions &ndash; improve utility
        * Generalized solutions &ndash; improve longevity

2. A package for making section-level and global-level edits to a document
  * Discuss the research behind the tool
  * Guide to using the tool
  * Guide to “better editing” strategies?
  * Need:
    * Software for which to build macros
      * I'm considering [Atom](https://atom.io/)
    * Help with coding (Node.js for Atom)
  * Deliverable:
    * Web page explaining the package
      * How to use it and **why** to use it
    * Package itself
