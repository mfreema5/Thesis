## Goal

The report explored ways to assess the impact of research.  That assessment method should, among other things:

  &ldquo;encompass the full range of economic, social, public policy, welfare, cultural and quality-of-life benefits&rdquo;

The report reviewed existing practices, and used them to create guidance for HEFCE.

### Existing practices reviewed

* RQF &ndash; Research Quality and Accessibility Framework
  * Australia
* RAISS &ndash; RAND/ARC Impact Scoring System
  * UK
* PART &ndash; Program Assessment Rating Tool
  * U.S.
* ERiC &ndash; Evaluating Research in Context
  * The Netherlands

## Intro

  &ldquo;Research assessment will combine quantitative indicators – including bibliometric indicators wherever these are appropriate – and expert/peer review. Which of these elements are employed, and the balance between them, will vary as appropriate to each subject. The economic and social impact of research, as well as impact upon public policy, will also contribute to the overall assessment of quality.&rdquo; (p.1)

The key phrase being &lsquo;economic and social impact of research&rsquo;&mdash;what I've been calling *practical impact*.

## RFQ

  &ldquo;RQF defined &lsquo;impact&rsquo; as: &lsquo;The social, economic, environmental and/or cultural benefit of research to end users in the wider community regionally, nationally and/or internationally&rsquo;.&rdquo;

### WRGI &ndash; Working Group on Research Impact

The RAND report supposedly quotes the following verbatim from the report by the WGRI, but I have yet to find a copy of that.  (More digging?)

**Principles**

* &lsquo;The assessment of research impact is an incentive for researchers to focus on the outcomes of their research insofar as these provide benefit to Australia's society, economy, environment and/or culture&rsquo;
* &lsquo;The RQF seeks to identify and reward excellence in research, and is by definition inequitable. However, it is a fundamental principle that the impact assessment model will apply equally across all research fields and disciplines&rsquo;.
* &lsquo;Impact assessment will complement research quality, as determined by the RQF, and while the underlying research must be demonstrably sound it does not necessarily have to score highly on Quality assessment to be rated for Impact&rsquo;.
* &lsquo;Pure basic research will not be disadvantaged by the RQF, and neither shall this essential research be devalued. While Research Groupings focussed on pure basic research are unlikely to derive much benefit from the assessment of impact, they should be able to perform well in quality assessments. Conversely, Research Groupings that have an applied focus and may not achieve high ratings for quality, will have the opportunity to demonstrate their excellence through the impact assessment&rsquo;.
* &lsquo;Research impact will be based on actual outcomes and their assessable impact. Prospective impact will not be part of the RQF&rsquo;.
* &lsquo;Research which leads to tangible and assessable impact must, to some demonstrable degree, have been conducted recently, as the eventual impact assessment will be used to determine future research funding allocations&rsquo;.
* &lsquo;A key principle is to direct RQF-related funding towards that research which generates impact. Hence, funding should be allocated towards institutions whose Research Groupings successfully demonstrate claims against any of the impact criteria. This will encourage behaviours that lead to a greater uptake of Australian research. Rewarding excellence is a further key principle, with enhanced funding distributed to institutions with Research Groupings receiving the highest impact ratings&rsquo;.
* &lsquo;The natural unit of Impact assessment is the Research Grouping. These groupings already exist in many cases, and the grouping&rsquo;s rationale and strategy is an essential component of measuring Impact. It should be at the discretion of the research institution to select Research Groupings for the RQF, with the institution having discretion over how many Groupings and which staff are included for assessment. This entails that smaller Research Groupings should be accommodated, to a minimum of five group members with no upper limit&rsquo;.

----

WGRI recommended that research groups submit a *Context Statment* and a *Impact Statment*, with supporting case studies.

* Impact Statement
  * Engagement
  * End-user results
  * Societal benefits
  * Magnitude of those benefits

#### Indicative impact indicators

While WGRI had largely rejected quantitative analysis for final assessments, they encouraged the inclusion of any from a wide variety of &ldquo;indicative impact indicators&rdquo; as part of the case studies that support impact statements.  These included citation counts, but also indicators such as new products brought to market, royalties, and increased literacy rates.

### Pilot runs

They were done.  I can't find any of the outputs.

### Effect on funding

A primary intent of the RFQ was to provide input on research funding.  Accoring to RAND, the RFQ results would not impact more than 10% of over-all funding for research institutions.

The RFQ ratings of research groups within an institution would be aggregated and the aggregate used in funding decisions.

### Expert Panels

&ldquo;Expert Assessment Panels&rdquo; did the final assessment of research groups.  The panels included experts in the discipline as well as end-users.  Thus stakeholders were directly included in the assessment.

### RAND comments

One of the key lessons identified in the RAND report is that impact metrics alone are not sufficient to assess the overall societal impact of research.

## ERiC

  &ldquo;There is significant interest in developing approaches to assess broader impacts of research in the Netherlands. Traditionally, assessment has focused on academic rigour, but this was not felt to reflect the broad outputs of academic research across the portfolio (Spaapen, 2005).&rdquo;

The Dutch approach separates the characteristics of &lsquo;quality&rsquo;, &lsquo;productivity&rsquo;, &lsquo;relevance&rsquo;, etc.  Citation metrics and the like can be included in all of those first three, while socio-economic impact is consolidated into the third (&lsquo;relevance&rsquo;).

The methodology relies heavily on surveys and interviews, and explicitly includes stakeholders.

There was no clear tie of ERiC assessments to funding.
