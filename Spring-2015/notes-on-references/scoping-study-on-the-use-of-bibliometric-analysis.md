## Quotes

  &ldquo;Thus, the bibliometric method will fail to assess adequately those research activities where CI-covered journals play a minor role in the communication of research results. Furthermore, assessment of the socio-economic impact of research requires other approaches than the bibliometric methodology (Airaghi et al 1999), although the previous chapter showed that specific aspects of knowledge use can be measured by bibliometric analysis. Nevertheless, analysis of research performance on the basis of journals unavoidably introduces a ‘bibliometrically limited view of a complex reality’ Truth, as John von Neumann stated, is too complicated to allow anything but approximations.&rdquo; (p. 31)

  &ldquo;Citation counts can be seen as manifestations of intellectual influence, but the concepts of citation impact and intellectual influence do not necessarily coincide. Citation impact is a quantitative concept that can be operationalised in an elementary fashion or in more sophisticated ways, such as crude citation counts versus field-normalised measures. Concepts such as ‘intellectual influence’ are essentially theoretical concepts of a qualitative nature, and have to be assessed by taking into account the cognitive contents of the work under evaluation. Thus, the outcomes of bibliometric analysis must be valued in a qualitative, evaluative framework that takes into account the contents of the work.&rdquo; (p. 31)

  &ldquo;In the application of indicators, no matter how advanced, it remains of the utmost importance to know the limitations of the method and to guard against misuse, exaggerated expectations of non-expert users, and undesired manipulations by scientists themselves (Adam 2002; Butler 2003; Weingart 2003; Glänzel and Debackere 2003).&rdquo; (p. 32)
  
  &ldquo;Metrics, particularly advanced analysis, provides the tools to keep the peer review process objective and transparent. Metrics and peer review both have their strengths and limits. The challenge is to combine the two methodologies in such a way that the strengths of one compensates for the limitations of the other.&rdquo; (p. 32)
