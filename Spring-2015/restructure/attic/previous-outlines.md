# Incarnations of the Outline

## Current Outline

* Practical Impact – a thesis
  * Preface: document structure
* Null-hypothesis significance testing
  * Losing importance in the search for significance
* Making importance once again important
  * Demonstrate importance through effect sizes
  * From calculations to precedents
  * Using precedents as estimates
* Simplify the problem…
  * …By expanding it
  * Find out from practitioners what they consider relevant
  * Specifics of what would be tracked
* Existing metrics
  * Journal-level citation metrics
  * Finding the “indispensable” journals
  * Counting citations to sort journals
  * Compiling citations for multiple fields
  * Reporting ratios instead of counts
  * Selecting what years to include
  * Samples, not populations, of citations
  * So, what's a JIF, anyway?
  * Altmetrics - overview
  * Altmetrics - examples related to practical impact
* Don't require practical impact; reward it
* Promote practical impact, and trivial results will fade


## Previous Outline

* What is “practical impact”?  It's when research informs practice.
* Why is the “practical impact” of research interesting?
  * On-going empirical research into trivial correlations in social sciences
  * Lack of relevance in management research
  * Increasing demand to demonstrate practical value of research by funding agencies
  * Value of practical impact may not be captured by citation metrics
* What is a “citation-based metrics such as the Journal Impact Factor”?
  * Explaining the Journal Impact Factor through its historical foundations
  * Finding the “indispensable” journals
  * Counting citations to sort journals
  * Compiling citations for multiple fields
  * Reporting ratios instead of counts
  * Selecting what years to include
  * Samples, not populations, of citations
  * So, what's a JIF, anyway?
* Tracking practical impact
  * Altmetrics breaks out of academic silo that isolates most bibliometric methods
  * The Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS)
  * Higher Education Funding Council for England – REF
* Uses of practical impact information
  * Determination of funding (e.g., HEFCE-REF)
  * Judging “quality of research”
  * Improving knowledge transfer between researchers and practitioners
* Hazards of ignoring practical value
  * “Gaming” system through statistical power
  * Losing funding [see: HEFCE-REF]
  * Rewards that are based only citation-metrics begets research that maximizes citations, and only citations
  * Is it ethical to leave practitioners ignorant of knowledge that would improve their outcomes?
* Hazards of making practical value requisite
* Rewarding practical impact
* Categorizing practical impact
  * Comparisons should always be within the same, or similar, fields
  * Qualitative process
  * Too many possible sources for practical impact data to equitably quantify
  * Different fields have varying levels of practical impact
* Levels of practical impact
  * U – Unknown/undefined
  * A – Apparent
  * I – Important
* Conclusion / Reiteration
