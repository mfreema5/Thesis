#### Refinements on the Journal Impact Factor

#### *SNIP* &ndash; Source Normalized Indicator of journal impact per Paper

As mentioned earlier, the lack of cross-field comparisons in the Journal Impact Factor means that its use is problematic for institutions that want to equitably evaluate the quality of research done by faculty and staff in an array of fields.  The Journal Impact Factor of journals cannot be compared between fields “because citation practices can vary significantly from one field to another” (Moed 2011).

The source normalized indicator of journal impact per paper, ‘*SNIP*’, includes refinements to address this problem; specifically it addresses that problem through the normalization of citations.  SNIP normalizes the citation rates of articles against the average number of cited references per paper in that subject field (Moed 2010).  In a simplistic example, if the articles in a field typically cite 10 articles, then a set of articles with a non-normalized citations rate of 12 would have a normalized citation rate of 1.2, which can be characterized as above average *for that field*.

To normalize away the differences in citation practices, however, requires properly delineating where those differences exist; in an article responding to criticisms of SNIP, Moed (2010) cites Garfield (1979) who reported that citation practices differ not only between fields, but between specialties and sub-specialties.

To ensure that a journal's citations are normalized against an appropriate field of research, within SNIP a particular journal's field is not determined by categorization but instead it is defined by what articles cite the journal.  In other words, the “field” is the collection of all articles *outside* the journal that contain citations to articles *inside* the journal.  (It should be noted that the term “article” is being used here loosely.  A more accurate description might be “citable document”, since within SNIP “*articles*, *conference proceedings papers* and *reviews* are considered as fully fledged, peer-reviewed research articles” (Moed 2010).)  In short, SNIP normalizes a journal's citations based on the field's average citations, where the field is defined by citations to the journal.

A version of SNIP that runs against the Scopus&reg; database is available on the Journal Metrics website, `www.journalmetrics.com` (Elsevier 2015).
