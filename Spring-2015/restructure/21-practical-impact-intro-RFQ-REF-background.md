# The move to include practical impact in evaluating research

## Examples from government initiatives and programs

### Background on the examples  

Both Australia and the United Kingdom have developed government programs that evaluate research institutions based on their “research quality” and “research impact”.  Those programs used “research quality” to refer to what is sometimes called the “academic impact” of research; it is a measure of the effect that research has on other research, and included some form of bibliometrics.

“Research impact” is the effect that research has *outside* of research and research institutions; it is an evaluation of the “full range of economic, social, public policy, welfare, cultural and quality-of-life benefits” (Grant *et al.* 2009) that can result from research.  In this thesis, it is referred to as “practical impact”.

#### Research Quality Framework (RQF)  

The history of the Research Quality Framework (RQF) is complicated.  It started in 2003 when the government established “an Expert Advisory Group, whose remit was to consult widely and develop a model for assessing the quality and impact of research in Australia” (Butler 2008).  The framework proposed by that group was published in 2006, and prompted the establishment of the Development Advisory Group, to “refine the RQF model” (Donovan 2008).  The first RFQ was scheduled to be run in 2008, but a change in government in 2007 instead meant that the program was scrapped (Donovan 2008).

However, the Research Quality Framework has influenced the development of similar programs, such as the Research Excellence Framework in the UK (Grant *et al.* 2009).

#### Research Excellence Framework (REF)  

The Higher Education Council for England “funds and regulates universities and colleges in England” (HEFCE 2015).

The HEFCE will be using the Research Excellence Framework (REF) “for the assessment and funding of research in UK higher education institutions”. The REF focuses on three elements (HEFCE 2009):

1. **Research quality** &ndash; research “will be assessed against criteria of ‘rigour, originality and significance’. By ‘significance’, we mean the extent to which research outputs display the capacity to make a difference either through intellectual influence within the academic sphere, or through actual or potential use beyond the academic sphere, or both.”
1. **Research impact** &ndash; “…demonstrable economic and social impacts that have been achieved through activity within the [research institution] that builds on excellent research.”
1. **Research environment** &ndash; “…the extent to which the [research institution] has developed a research infrastructure, and a range of supporting activity, conducive to a continuing flow of excellent research and to its effective dissemination and application.”

However, the three elements are not equally weighted: “The assessment of research impact will be one of three distinct elements of the REF, being judged alongside research excellence and research environment, contributing 25% towards the overall outcome (as compared with 60% and 15% for quality and environment).” (Technopolis 2010)

A pilot exercise of the REF was conducted in 2009.
