Prequel:

* What is an “impact”?
  * Is an impact some specific outcome?
  * Can an impact be quantified?
  * How can you compare the impacts between research?

### How has impact been defined:
 * In RFQ, Donovan (2008) reports there were competing definitions…

### How has impact been evaluated:
 * The final recommendation for the RFQ was a five-step scale….  As Donovan (2008) reports, though, there was also a three-point scale, that was more inclusive, and less specific to applying research in industry…

### In this context, how has research quality been evaluated? 
 * In the RFQ, the quality of research was determined by panels of experts, that were assisted by “quantitative performance measures” (Butler 2008).
  * A “suite” of metrics were used.  The working group on metrics specifically recommended “that no attempt be made to aggregate the indicators to produce a single score” (Butler 2008).
    * “Venues”&mdash;meaning journals, conferences, publishers, etc.&mdash;were classified into ranked tiers, and publications evaluated based on the tier of the venue in which they appeared.
    * Citation counts were evaluated in a number of ways: simple counts, averages, centile distributions.  For some areas, citations in “non-standard” venues were included, but discouraged because of the increased labor involved over using established citation indicies.
  * A number of metrics were rejected.  The most interesting of which is the ISI Impact Factor.
    * “It was believed that actual citation counts are a far better citation measure for judging the performance of groups than surrogates based on the average citation rates of the journals which carry that work. There were also concerns about the way in which the indicator is calculated and anecdotal evidence of increasing manipulation of the indicator by a few journal editors. Even when ranking journals, some disciplines had already made it clear that they wished to look beyond the Impact Factor and undertake a more detailed assessment of the quality of journals.” (Butler 2008)

### How has impact been combined with quality?
 * The RFQ relied on panels of experts to evaluate both quality and impact of research.  Each panel had 12 members, 3 of whom represented “end users” of research (Butler 2008).
   * One of the difficulties in combining quality and impact is that the most appropriate time window for each process is not only different from the other, but may not overlap at all.  While fundamental research was exempted from the impact evaluation entirely because of this disconnect in time windows (the impact of fundamental research is indirect, happening through subsequent research, and therefore is even more delayed than non-basic research), Donovan (2008) contends that the window for non-exempted research is still too short to properly capture the impact of the subsequent research.  Therefore, fundamental research is still being devalued despite being exempted from direct evaluation.
