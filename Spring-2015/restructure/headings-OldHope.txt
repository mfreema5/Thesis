15-        Practical impact
19-          What is “practical impact”?  It's when research informs practice.
36-          Why is the “practical impact” of research interesting?
40-            On-going empirical research into trivial correlations in social sciences
58-            Lack of relevance in management research
66-            Increasing demand to demonstrate practical value of research by funding agencies
74-            Value of practical impact may not be captured by citation metrics
100-          What is a &ldquo;citation-based metrics such as the Journal Impact Factor&rdquo;?
104-            Explaining the Journal Impact Factor through its historical foundations
112-            Finding the &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo; journals
129-            Counting citations to sort journals
152-            Compiling citations for multiple fields
172-            Reporting ratios instead of counts
228-            Selecting what years to include
248-            Samples, not populations, of citations
259-            So, what's a JIF, anyway?
279-          Tracking practical impact
283-            Altmetrics breaks out of academic silo that isolates most bibliometric methods

358-            “Gaming” system through statistical power
372-            Losing funding [see: HEFCE-REF]
380-            Rewards that are based only citation-metrics begets research that maximizes citations, and only citations
388-            Is it ethical to leave practitioners ignorant of knowledge that would improve their outcomes?

425-          Rewarding practical impact
442-          Categorizing practical impact
446-            Comparisons should always be within the same, or similar, fields
466-            Qualitative process
470-              Too many possible sources for practical impact data to equitably quantify
