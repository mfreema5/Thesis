# Starting Over

## Audience and purpose

* Audience is &ldquo;academical&rdquo;
  * People who write academic (research) articles
  * People employed by research institutions
  * People who edit/publish academic research
  * People employed by publishers of research articles
* Purpose(s)
  * Demonstrate my ability to write an academic piece
    * Explain how &ldquo;practical impact&rdquo; is growing in importance
  * Demonstrate my technology skills through &lsquo;tawp&rsquo;
    * …by showing ways to make academic writing/content more accessible?

## New outline &ndash; &ldquo;How we judge the relative value of research&rdquo;

#### Currently
* Journal-level metrics
  * Journal Impact Factor
  * Refinements on JIF
* Article-level metrics
  * h-Index
  * Altmetrics
* Problems with these
  * Lack of relevance
  * &ldquo;Seduced by the apparent objectivity of numbers&rdquo;

#### Expected future &ndash; Practical impact
* Examples (overview)
  * HEFCE-REF
  * Austrialian prototype
  * U.S. PART program (name?)
* How the examples worked (details)
  * Case studies
  * Evaluation panels (which include practitioners)

#### How to prepare (&ldquo;Future Research&rdquo;) (a.k.a., Mike rambles on)

(How can I make this more research-question like?)

* Minimize use of jargon and TLAs
* Update format of journal articles
* Update online presentation of research/articles
  * Bundle commentary and response with original artifact?
  * Embed links to references? To citations? To practical impact?
* Update peer review process to include practitioners
  * Actively, e.g. as reviewers/gatekeepers of some sort
  * Passively, e.g., through hit counts, etc.

## “Recycling-text” outline

* How we judge the relative value of research &ndash; current
  * Journal-level metrics
    * Journal Impact Factor
    * Refinements on JIF
      * SNIP
      * SJR
        * Advantages of SJR over JIF:
  * Article-level metrics
    * h-Index
    * Altmetrics
      * “Manifesto”
  * Other approaches
  * Summaries of existing metrics
    * Journal-level metrics
    * Article-level metrics
      * CWTS (article-level) &ldquo;indicators&rdquo;
    * Some features of both journal- and article-level metrics
  * Problems with this/these
    * Lack of relevance
    * &ldquo;Seduced by the apparent objectivity of numbers&rdquo;
* How we judge the relative value of research &ndash; expected future includes Practical Impact
  * What is practical impact
    * Do current metrics capture practical impact
  * Examples of ways to evaluate pratical impact
    * HEFCE-REF
    * Austrialian prototype
    * U.S. PART program (name?)
  * How the examples worked (details)
    * Case studies
    * Evaluation panels (which include practitioners)
* Future research
* Conclusion
