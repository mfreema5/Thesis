# Starting Over

## Audience and purpose

* Audience is &ldquo;academical&rdquo;
  * People who write academic (research) articles
  * People employed by research institutions
  * People who edit/publish academic research
  * People employed by publishers of research articles
* Purpose(s)
  * Demonstrate my ability to write an academic piece
  * Explain how &ldquo;practical impact&rdquo; is growing in importance
  * Demonstrate my technology skills through &lsquo;tawp&rsquo;
    * â€¦by showing ways to make academic writing/content more accessible?

## New outline &ndash; &ldquo;How we judge the relative value of research&rdquo;

#### Currently
* Journal-level metrics
  * Journal Impact Factor
  * Refinements on JIF
* Article-level metrics
  * h-Index
  * Altmetrics
* Problems with these
  * Lack of relevance
  * &ldquo;Seduced by the apparent objectivity of numbers&rdquo;

#### Expected future &ndash; Practical impact
* Examples (overview)
  * HEFCE-REF
  * Austrialian prototype
  * U.S. PART program (name?)
* How the examples worked (details)
  * Case studies
  * Evaluation panels (which include practitioners)

#### How to prepare (&ldquo;Future Research&rdquo;) (a.k.a., Mike rambles on)
* Minimizing use of jargon and TLAs
* Updating format of journal articles
* Update online presentation of research/articles
  * Bundle commentary and response with original artifact?
  * Embed links to references? To citations? To practical impact?
* Update peer review process to include practitioners
  * Actively, e.g. as reviewers/gatekeepers of some sort
  * Passively, e.g., through hit counts, etc.
