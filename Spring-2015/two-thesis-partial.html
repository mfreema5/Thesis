          I started working on this thesis during the Autumn of 2014.  In December of that year, the first version, “Practical impact &ndash; a thesis,” went live on my webpage at <em>www.freeman.blue</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the Spring of 2015, I worked on revising that thesis.  One of the major revisions was the removal of all discussion of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST).  
        </p>
        <p>
          I had initially looked at the practical-impact of research as a way of discussing how the misunderstanding and misapplication of NHST methodologies was under-cutting the relevance of research in social sciences, specifically in the area of management. But the issue of the practical impact of research has a wider reach than that. The Research Excellence Framework being applied to institutions of higher education in the U.K. is not restricted to any particular field.  The focus on NHST in the first version of the thesis interfered with the discussion of examples of how the practical impact of research has been evaluated.

        <p>
          Thus the current version of the thesis, “Finding Research Value &ndash; the metrics and methods for evaluating research”.  There are links to both versions of the thesis on this page.

          Tracking practical impact so as to abate the misuse of null-hypothesis significance testing
        </h2>
        <p>
          The misuse of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) as a <i>de facto</i> measure of the importance of research results has been recognized as an issue in social science research for decades.  There has been growing concern over the apparent lack of research relevance in many fields, with some citing the misuse of NHST as one of the causes of that loss of relevance. This suggests that a solution for the problem of the misuse of NHST may be found by addressing the wider issue of relevance to practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This thesis proposes a “practical impact” metric, modeled on existing bibliometrics that are used as proxies for evaluating the “scientific impact” of research.  By rewarding research that has practical impact, researchers can be encouraged to find and write about effects which are not only statistically significant, but also important, thus abating the misuse of NHST.
