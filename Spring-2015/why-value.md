## Why “value”?

* “Quality” is judged in relation to other research, and norms in the field
  * Bibliometrics (quantitative analysis of published materials) ties in well.
    * Citations indicate relationship between research
    * Peer-reviewed journals check that research conforms to norms
  * “Research impact” is used to also describe the effect of research on other research
    * Also related to bibliometrics
  * But “research impact” is also sometimes used to describe what I usually call “practical impact” 
    * The effect of research on practice
    * The government evaluation frameworks have a wider view
      * Any positive effect outside of research institutions
  * So, “quality” is too restricted, and “impact” is too ambiguous.
  * “Value” doesn't have those problems, with the added benefit of an implication of money
    * The Research Excellence Framework of the Higher Education Funding Council for England is a tool used to help allocate funding based on the evaluation of research.
    * This influence of the value of research on the allocation resources cascades down to every level.
